    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This program offers a comprehensive look into the basic principles of blockchain technology, such as the formation, authentication, and administration of blocks within a chain. The program encompasses both Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus methods, enabling users to experience different approaches to reaching an agreement within a distributed network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blockchain commences with the inception of a Genesis Block, which acts as the origin of the chain. Users are then prompted to determine if they wish to mine additional blocks, choosing a consensus method for each block. Under the PoW approach, miners solve computational puzzles by identifying a nonce value that meets specific difficulty requirements. This process, known as mining, rewards the successful miner with the ability to add the new block to the chain. In the PoS mechanism, validators are selected based on their stake, in other word, the cryptocurrency they hold, with a higher stake increasing the likelihood of being chosen as the validator for the next block.\n",
    "\n",
    "As new blocks are added, the program continually verifies the integrity of the blockchain. It ensures that each block's hash is accurately calculated based on its contents and the previous block's hash, guaranteeing that the chain is unaltered and has not been tampered with. Additionally, specific checks are performed for PoW blocks (validating if the hash meets the difficulty criteria) and PoS blocks (confirming the inclusion of the validator information).\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the process, the program generates detailed output, displaying the specifics of each newly created block, including its hash, timestamp, data, previous hash, and nonce value. Users can continue mining new blocks or exit the program, at which point the program checks and reports the validity of the entire blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design serves as a hands-on illustration of the fundamental concepts behind blockchain technology, enabling users to understand the concept of block formation, consensus methods, and chain verification."
